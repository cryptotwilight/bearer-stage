# Bearer Stage - Decentralized Autonomous Bearer Token Financing 

The Bearer Stage project has been created to enable the autonomous financing of Bearer Tokens. Bearer Tokens are tokens that are tied to physical utility such as a night stay in a hotel, a car rental or even a flight. Bearer Stage enables suppliers to get paid upfront whilst enabling distributors to finance large purchases of inventory using decentralized finance. Distributors are then able to sell large amounts of inventory at market timescales without incurring the financing overhead. 
For investors funds are invested for a given emmisssion at a given residual. Investors recieve a perpetual coupon that pays out a fixed monthly level of interest during the initial. Investors can withdraw their funds after the expiry of the term at a given residual.
